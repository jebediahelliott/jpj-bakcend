          At John P. Jones Canine Training, we will train any dog that walks in the door regardless of issues. We train for the spirit of the dog, whether that means maintaining a dog's high-spirits or rehabilitating a dog in need of help. Many of the most well behaved dogs that train with us today were once problem dogs. Our training is based on the dog: we do not cookie-cutter train. Every dog is different and we train each dog differently, as no one method works for all dogs. We do not push dogs through training. If the best thing for the dog is to take a little extra time between classes, then we will do what is best for the dog. All training begins with a series of private lessons. We start off training in a controlled environment and add controlled distractions as you progress through the program. You will then move into a group class with other dogs in which you learn to train in a more challenging environment. This is where you and your dog apply training to more real-life situations. Along with teaching control through obedience exercises, we will also address your specific goals and areas of concern that have led you to our door, i.e. aggression, walking down the street, destructive behavior, jumping up, etc. We enjoy helping people achieve titles on their dogs, yet we also understand that not every owner aims to compete with their dog and is simply looking to have fun with their companion. Many people enjoy training with us because of the safe, fun environment we provide for every trained dog. In fact, many of our clients come to classes regularly to train their dogs for years at a time, going beyond the offered programs. It is our job as trainers to see that you succeed and have fun with your dog. We want you to be happy with your dog and we want your dog to be happy through training. We will help you meet your goals for your dog in order for you to have fun with your companion throughout its lifetime.
